## Chapter 1: Introudction to Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs)

# 1.1 Basic Information About Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs)

Cardiovascular Disease is a general name for numerous types of diseases including heart attack, stroke, and heart failure. In 2019 an estimated 17.9 million people died from Cardiovascular Diseases and 85% were due to heart attack and stroke.

# 1.2 Reasons of Choosing Cardiovascular Disease.
As living standards are improving over the past few decades, having a healthy lifestyle and avoiding serious illnesses have become people’s priorities and Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally our group is interested in finding out some facts about Cardiovascular Disease such as what exactly Cardiovascular Diseases are. What are some factors that are correlate to Cardiovascular Diseases, among those factors what have the strongest correlation to Cardiovascular Diseases? And would a healthy lifestyle help to prevent people from having cardiovascular disease? Therefore, our group choose this dataset about Cardiovascular Diseases

## Chapter 2: Summary of the Dataset

# 2.1:About the Dataset
The Cardiovascular Diseases dataset is extracted from Kaggle. It contains information from 70,000 records of patients that provided their age, height, weight, physical condition, and habits. Studying such data can help the public and health organizations identify potential factors that could lead to a higher chance of getting Cardiovascular Diseases, and develop appropriate strategies to reduce the number of patients.
The dataset is cardio_train.csv. Before doing any analysis on this dataset, we did some research about what every single variable in the dataset represents, why they are included in this dataset, and what variables we will use in our model. With all those information government agents and the public will know how to adjust their habits or lifestyle to prevent getting Cardiovascular Diseases. Therefore, it is crucial to figure out current problems, and then publish the information.

# 2.2: Variables

There are a total of 13 variables in this dataset, including integer, and numeric, we will only use part of the variables in our dataset. There are some outliers in this model. However, overall they do not have a strong impact on our model, and we decided not to remove them. Also for our model, we did some cleanup and convert some of the variables into factor variables so we can better process them.  

```{r}
str(CVD)
```

1.`id`: Respondents'id | id | int

2.`Age`: Respondents' age | age | int (days)

3.`Height`: Respondents' height | height | int (cm)

4.`Weight`: Respondents' weight | weight | num (kg)

5.`Gender`: Respondents'gender | gender  | int (1:Feale|2:Male)

6.`Systolic blood pressure`: Respondents' systolic blood pressure | ap_hi | int 

7.`Diastolic blood pressure`: Respondents' diastolic blood pressure | ap_lo | int

8.`Cholesterol`: Respondents' cholesterol level | cholesterol | int (1: normal, 2: above normal, 3: well above normal)

9.`Glucose`: Respondents' glucose level | gluc | int (1: normal, 2: above normal, 3: well above normal)

10.`Smoking`: Whether respondent smokes or not | smoke | int (0:Do not smoke, 1:Smoke) 

11.`Alcohol intake`: Whether respondent drink or not | alco | int (0:Do not drink, 1: Drink)

12.`Physical activity`: Respondents' do not physical activity regularly | active | int (0:Workout regularly, 1: No workout regularly)

13.`Presence or absence of cardiovascular disease`: Respondent present cardiovascular disease | cardio | int (0:No CVD currently present, 1:CVD currently present)

## Chapter 3: Descriptive Statistics

# 3.1 Categorical Variables EDA
# 3.1.1 Are there any common in CVD patients?
We choose several factors from the dataset and check if there are some factors that have a significant difference between CVD presented and CVD not presented.All the tables below will use percentage. 

We start with smoke history and whether CVD are currently presented or not.

Smoke
```{r,results='markup'}
library(dplyr)
smoke_con<-aggregate(CVD$cardio, by=list(CVD$smoke,CVD$cardio), FUN=length)
smoke_con<-rename(smoke_con,Smoke = Group.1,CVD_presence = Group.2,CVD = x)
smoke_con$Smoke[smoke_con$Smoke=="0"] <- 'Not smoke'
smoke_con$Smoke[smoke_con$Smoke=="1"] <- 'Smoke'
smoke_con$CVD_presence[smoke_con$CVD_presence=="0"] <- 'Not Present'
smoke_con$CVD_presence[smoke_con$CVD_presence=="1"] <- 'Present'
xkabledply(smoke_con)
```

The result showed most respondents do not smoke, and almost half of the respondents have CVD currently presented. 

alcohol intake 
```{r,results='markup'}
alco_con<-aggregate(CVD$cardio,by=list(CVD$alco,CVD$cardio), FUN=length)
alco_con<-rename(alco_con,alco = Group.1,CVD_presence = Group.2,CVD = x)
alco_con$alco[alco_con$alco=="0"] <- 'Not drink'
alco_con$alco[alco_con$alco=="1"] <- 'Drink'
alco_con$CVD_presence[alco_con$CVD_presence=="0"] <- 'Not Present'
alco_con$CVD_presence[alco_con$CVD_presence=="1"] <- 'Present'
xkabledply(alco_con)
```

The result showed most respondents do not drink, and almost half of the respondents have CVD currently presented. 

Physical Activity
```{r,results='markup'}
active_con<-aggregate(CVD$cardio, by=list(CVD$active,CVD$cardio), FUN=length)
active_con<-rename(active_con,active = Group.1,CVD_presence = Group.2,CVD = x)
active_con$active[active_con$active=="0"] <- 'Physical Activity'
active_con$active[active_con$active=="1"] <- 'Not Physical Activity'
active_con$CVD_presence[active_con$CVD_presence=="0"] <- 'Not Present'
active_con$CVD_presence[active_con$CVD_presence=="1"] <- 'Present'
xkabledply(active_con)
```

The result showed most respondents do not physical activity regularly, and most of the respondents have CVD currently presented. However, there are more people who have physical activity regularly compared to smoking and drinking. 

 # 3.1.2 Plot comparing different factors

With all the tables above, we plot graphs accordingly, from the graphs we will have a better idea to see if there are any variables that may have a significant impact on getting Cardio Vascular Diseases. 

Plot of Smoke & CVD
```{r,results='markup'}
smoke_pic <- data.frame(table(CVD$smoke,CVD$cardio))
names(smoke_pic) <- c("Smoke","Cardio","Count")
ggplot(data=smoke_pic, aes(x=Smoke, y=Count/sum(Count)*100, fill=Cardio)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")+scale_x_discrete(labels=c("0" = "Not smoke", "1" = "Smoke"))+scale_fill_discrete(labels=c("0" = "No cvd presented", "1" = "CVD presented"))+ggtitle("Percentage of Smoke history and present of CVDs") + ylab("Percentage")
```

Plot of alcohol intake & CVD
```{r,results='markup'}
alco_pic <- data.frame(table(CVD$alco,CVD$cardio))
names(alco_pic) <- c("alco","Cardio","Count")
ggplot(data=alco_pic, aes(x=alco, y=Count/sum(Count)*100, fill=Cardio)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")+scale_x_discrete(labels=c("0" = "Not Drink", "1" = "Drink"))+scale_fill_discrete(labels=c("0" = "No cvd presented", "1" = "CVD presented"))+ggtitle("Percentage of alcohol intake and present of CVDs") + ylab("Percentage")
```

Plot of physical activity & CVD
```{r,results='markup'}
active_pic <- data.frame(table(CVD$active,CVD$cardio))
names(active_pic) <- c("active","Cardio","Count")
ggplot(data=active_pic, aes(x=active, y=Count/sum(Count)*100, fill=Cardio)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")+scale_x_discrete(labels=c("0" = "Workout regularly", "1" = "Not workout regularly"))+scale_fill_discrete(labels=c("0" = "No cvd presented", "1" = "CVD presented"))+ggtitle("Percentage of workout and present of CVDs") + ylab("Percentage")
```

The graphs proved the results are pretty clear that most respondents do not have a smoking history or drinking history while there are more people who have physical activity regularly. However, from the graphs the chance of getting Cardio-Vascular Diseases seems pretty even regarding their lifestyle. We will use chi-square test below to further test if these variables are independent from whether Cardio-Vascular Diseases are presented. 

# 3.1.3 Chi-Square Tests

Since there are 
The results of the chi-square test result are listed below accordingly. 


Chi-square test for Smoke & CVD presence

Are they independent?
- H0: CVD presence and smoking are independent.
- H1: They are not independent.

```{r,results='hide'}
smoke_cvd = table(CVD$cardio, CVD$smoke)
```

```{r,results='markup'}
sctest<- chisq.test(smoke_cvd)
sctest
```

Since the p-value is 4e-05 < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, therefore smoking has a significant impact on whether cardio-vascular diseases are presented. 

Chi-square test for Alcohol intake & CVD presence

Are they independent?
- H0: CVD presence and drinking are independent.
- H1: They are not independent.

```{r,results='hide'}
al_cvd = table(CVD$cardio, CVD$alco)
```
```{r,results='markup'}
alctest<- chisq.test(al_cvd)
alctest
```

Since the p-value is 0.05 ≤ 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, therefore drink has a significant impact on whether cardio-vascular diseases are presented. 

Chi-square test for Physical Activity & CVD presence

Are they independent?
- H0: CVD presence and physical activity are independent.
- H1: They are not independent.

```{r,results='hide'}
act_cvd = table(CVD$cardio, CVD$active)
```
```{r,results='markup'}
act_test<- chisq.test(act_cvd)
act_test
```

Since the p-value is 2e-16 < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, therefore physical activity has a significant impact on whether cardio-vascular diseases are presented. 


# Chapter 4: Continuous Variables EDA to Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs)

After a brief overview of the dataset, it tells that there are 3 continuous variables, age, height and weight.

## 4.1 KDE plot of continuous variables



KDE plot represents the data using a continuous probability density curve in one or more dimensions. We can easily observe the distribution of samples with kde plot








```{r}

str(CVD)

```


```{r}


CVD$cardio <- factor(CVD$cardio)
str(CVD)

```






```{r}

CVD_new<- data.frame(CVD)
CVD_new
```


```{r}


levels(CVD_new$cardio) <- c("No CVD Present", "CVD Present") 
str(CVD_new)

CVD_new$cardio[CVD_new$cardio=="0"] <- 'No CVD Present'
CVD_new$cardio[CVD_new$cardio=="1"] <- 'CVD Present'
CVD_new
```


```{r}


levels(CVD_new$cardio) <- c("No CVD Present", "CVD Present") 
str(CVD_new)

CVD_new$cardio[CVD_new$cardio=="0"] <- 'No CVD Present'
CVD_new$cardio[CVD_new$cardio=="1"] <- 'CVD Present'
CVD_new
```










```{r, results="markup"}
cols<-c("No CVD Present"="green","CVD Present"="blue")

```







```{r, results="markup"}
age_kdeplot <- ggplot(data = CVD_new, aes(x = age, color =cardio)) + 
            geom_density(aes(fill = cardio), alpha = 0.8) + 
             scale_fill_manual(values =cols) +
              labs(title="KDEplot for age") +
               labs(x="age", y="density") +
                theme(legend.position="top")
age_kdeplot


```


```{r, results="markup"}
age_kdeplot <- ggplot(data = CVD_new, aes(x = height, color = cardio)) + 
            geom_density(aes(fill = cardio), alpha = 0.8) + 
             scale_fill_manual(values =cols) +
              labs(title="KDEplot for height") +
               labs(x="height", y="density") +
                theme(legend.position="top")
age_kdeplot


```



```{r, results="markup"}
age_kdeplot <- ggplot(data = CVD_new, aes(x = weight, color = cardio)) + 
            geom_density(aes(fill = cardio), alpha = 0.8) + 
             scale_fill_manual(values= cols) +
              labs(title="KDEplot for weight") +
               labs(x="weight", y="density") +
                theme(legend.position="top")
age_kdeplot


```

As we can see from kdeplot for age, people with higher age are more likely to have CVD. And from kdeplot for height  and weight ,  we can find that  people with CVD and without CVD have very similar distributions. From these 3 kde plots, which means,CVD may be positive correlated with age. Finally, weight may only make a little attribution to people presenting CVD.

## 4.2 Logistic regression

The logit model is often used for classification and predictive analytics. Logistic regression estimates the probability of an event occurring, such as voted or didn’t vote, based on a given dataset of independent variables. Since the outcome is a probability, the dependent variable is bounded between 0 and 1(binary outcome). In this case, "cardio"  is the binary outcome; as s result, we choose logistic regression to predict.


```{r, results="markup"}


lm1 <- glm(cardio~age, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = CVD)
lm2 <- glm(cardio~age + weight, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = CVD)
lm3 <- glm(cardio~age+ height + weight, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = CVD)
anovat <- anova(lm1,lm2,lm3, test="LRT")
anovat

```

As it is shown above, model 2 and 3 is better than model 1 . In addition, model 2 and 3 is at 100% significant level.



## 4.3 AUC and ROC Curve

We can use AUC and ROC to measure model 2 and model 3. AUC (Area Under The Curve) - ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curve is a performance measurement for the classification problems at various threshold settings. ROC is a probability curve and AUC represents the degree or measure of separability. It tells how much the model is capable of distinguishing between classes. Higher the AUC, the better the model is at predicting 0 classes as 0 and 1 classes as 1. For summarize, the Higher the AUC, the better the model is.

For model 2:


```{r, results="markup"}
prob <- predict(lm2,CVD, type = c("response"))
CVD$prob <- prob
library(pROC)
g<- roc(cardio~prob, data = CVD)
plot(g, main = "ROC curve of model 2")
auc(CVD$cardio, prob)
```
The AUC value is 0.668. As 0.668 is much less than 1, this model is not good enough.


Below is the summary of model 2.

```{r, results="markup"}
xkabledply(lm2, title="summary of model 2")
```

For model 3:



```{r, results="markup"}
prob1 <- predict(lm3,CVD, type = c("response"))
CVD$prob1 <- prob1
library(pROC)
g<- roc(cardio~prob1, data = CVD)
plot(g, main = "ROC curve of model 3")
auc(CVD$cardio, prob1)
```
The AUC value is 0.671. As 0.671 is much less than 1 and 0.671 is more than 0.668, this model is not good enough but is better than model 2.


Below is the summary of model 3.

```{r, results="markup"}
xkabledply(lm3, title="summary of model 3")
```

In the 3 continuous variables, `cardio` has positive correlation with `age` and `weight` ; it also has negative correlation with`height` . It means when a person with  higher `weight` and shorter `height`, he has more probabilities to have Cardio Vascular Disease. And `age` is not significant influence factor to people `cardio` rates in 3 continuous variables.


# Chapter 5: EDA on the joint effect of influencing factors


From the results of above variables, we could find that some of the above variables have a significant effect on CVD. Next, we choose to graph the groups of variables with relatively large correlation coefficients one by one to explore how they affect the Cardio Vascular Disease.

## 5.1 Simple correlations

As most of variables are factors, we check their Spearman correlations.

```{r}
show(CVD_new)
```




```{r, results="markup"}

CVDNum = CVD

str(CVDNum)
```

```{r, results="markup"}

# convert categorical variable as numeric for spearman method
for(i in 1:13){
  # age, height, weight
  if (!(i %in% c(2, 4, 5))){
    CVDNum[,i] = as.numeric(CVDNum[,i])
              }
}
str(CVDNum)

```

```{r, results="markup"}

# corrplot with spearman method for categorical variables
CVDcor <- cor(subset(CVDNum, select=-c(id, prob)), method="spearman")
#CVDcor
loadPkg("corrplot")
#corrplot.mixed(CVDcor, tl.pos = "lt", number.cex = .5, tl.cex=0.8)
corrplot(CVDcor, type="lower", addCoef.col="black", number.cex=0.5, tl.cex=0.7,title="Spearman Correlation for CVD", mar=c(0,0,1,0))

```
Larger circle means higher correlation. We can see that CVD has negative correlation with cholesterol and height, which means that person who has shorter height or has high cholesterol is less likely to have Cardio Vascular Disease. Person who smoke and has high level cholesterol is also more likely to have CVD. So it makes sense that cholesterol  and smoke have positive correlation, which means most person who smoke also have high level cholesterol .

## 5.2 Will Age influence the CVD rate with other variables?


```{r}
CVD_new$gluc<- factor(CVD_new$gluc)
CVD_new$gender<- factor(CVD_new$gender)
CVD_new$smoke<- factor(CVD_new$smoke)
CVD_new$alco<- factor(CVD_new$alco)
CVD_new$active <- factor(CVD_new$active)
str(CVD_new)

```

```{r}
CVD_factor<- data.frame(CVD_new)
CVD_factor
```

```{r}

library(patchwork)
```

```{r, results="markup"}


a1 <- ggplot(CVD_factor,aes(x = smoke , y = age , fill = cardio)) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.5, aes(linetype=NA)) +
  xlab("Smoke") + ylab("Age")


a2 <- ggplot(CVD_factor,aes(x = alco , y = age , fill = cardio)) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.5, aes(linetype=NA)) +
  xlab("Alco") + ylab("Age")


a3 <- ggplot(CVD_factor, aes(x=height, y=age, color= cardio)) +
  geom_point(size=.5,alpha=0.4)


```

```{r, results="markup"}


a3/ (a1+a2) + plot_annotation(title = 'Age Plot')
```
First, Age and height show no correlation.

Second, for Smoke, the sample groups of smoke("1") and order age have higher CVD rates .

Finally, for cholesterol, people are also prone to CVD when drink alco("1") and order age.

## 5.3 Will Height influence the CVD rate with other variables?


```{r, results="markup"}


h1 <- ggplot(CVD_factor,aes(x = active , y = height , fill = cardio)) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.5, aes(linetype=NA)) +
  xlab("Active") + ylab("Height")



h2 <- ggplot(CVD_factor, aes(x=weight, y=height, color= cardio)) +
  geom_point(size=0.5,alpha=0.4)


```



```{r, results="markup"}


h1/ h2 + plot_annotation(title = 'Height Plot')
```

First, for Active, the sample groups of active("1") have little higher CVD rates.

Second, weight and height show a little positive correlation .



## 5.4 Will Weight influence the CVD rate with other variables?


```{r, results="markup"}


w1 <- ggplot(CVD_factor,aes(x = active , y = weight , fill = cardio)) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.5, aes(linetype=NA)) +
  xlab("Active") + ylab("Weight")


w2 <- ggplot(CVD_factor,aes(x = alco , y = weight , fill = cardio)) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.5, aes(linetype=NA)) +
  xlab("Alco") + ylab("Weight")




```



```{r, results="markup"}


w1/ w2 + plot_annotation(title = 'Weight Plot')
```

First, for Active, the sample groups of  active("1") have little higher CVD rates 

Second, for Alco, the sample groups of no alco ("0") have little higher CVD rates.
