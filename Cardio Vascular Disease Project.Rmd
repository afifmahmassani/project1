## Chapter 1: Introudction to Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs)

## Summary of the dataset

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

# 1.1 Basic Information About Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs)

Cardiovascular Disease is a general name for numerous types of diseases including heart attack, stroke, and heart failure. In 2019 an estimated 17.9 million people died from Cardiovascular Diseases and 85% were due to heart attack and stroke.

# 1.2 Reasons of Choosing Cardiovascular Disease.
As living standards are improving over the past few decades, having a healthy lifestyle and avoiding serious illnesses have become people’s priorities and Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally our group is interested in finding out some facts about Cardiovascular Disease such as what exactly Cardiovascular Diseases are. What are some factors that are correlate to Cardiovascular Diseases, among those factors what have the strongest correlation to Cardiovascular Diseases? And would a healthy lifestyle help to prevent people from having cardiovascular disease? Therefore, our group choose this dataset about Cardiovascular Diseases

>>>>>>> Stashed changes

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


Descriptive statistics:
In this dataset we will find out the factors causing the cardio vascular disease. 
This dataset contains 12 columns with 70000 values or records from different patients.
The columns are the following:
Age: This is the age of the patient and it is recorded in days
Height: This is the height of the patient and it is recorded in cm
Weight: This is the weight of the patient and it is recorded in kg
Gender: This is the gender of the patient (women, men)
Systolic blood pressure: This measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats (high)
Diastolic blood pressure: This measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart rests between beats (low)
Cholesterol: This is the cholesterol quantity (normal, above normal, well above normal)
Glucose: This is the glucose quantity (normal, above normal, well above normal)
Smoking: This shows whether the patient smokes or not
Alcohol intake: This shows the alcohol intake (0,1)
Physical activity: This shows the physical activity (0,1)
Presence or absence of cardiovascular disease: This shows the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease
