```{r init, include=F}
library(ezids)
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = F, results = "hide", message = F)
options(scientific=T, digits = 3) 
```

## Summary of the dataset

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
